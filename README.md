#G4P.Face
Games for Peace Face Expression Recognition Test

##Getting Started
Make sure you have [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/), [gulp](http://gulpjs.com) and [Bower](http://bower.io) installed.

In the `client` directory, run `gulp` to build the static web files. Then load the `G4P.UsagePatterns.sln` file with [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/visual-studio-homepage-vs.aspx) and press `F5` to host the website.

> //TODO: Create `setup.cmd` and `run.cmd` that takes care of DB installation, hosting etc.
